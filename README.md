<br>
This handbook is the canonical reference for how we build, maintain, and grow software at NysaClan.  
It captures our practices, principles, and process, not as rigid rules, but as shared guardrails and living guides.

## Why this exists

We are a fellowship of builders and researchers  
To preserve coherence across teams and projects, we need:

- Shared engineering standards  
- Common workflows and tooling  
- Transparent norms around code, review, deployment, and collaboration  
- A guide for newcomers to learn how we think and work  

This is not about imposing. but aligning, clarifying, and evolving together.

## What youâ€™ll find here

### Culture & Philosophy  
- Engineering principles & values  
- How we collaborate, give feedback, run meetings, and make decisions  

### Standards & Conventions  
- Language-specific style (Python, JavaScript, etc.)  
- API design, database norms, security practices  

### Workflows & Infrastructure  
- Git branching, commit conventions  
- CI/CD, testing, deployment  
- Containerization, monitoring, logging  
- Release processes  

### Onboarding & Growth  
- How to set up your dev environment  
- Your first PR walkthrough  
- Glossary of internal terms & philosophies  

### Resources  
- Tools we recommend  
- Further reading & reference materials  
- Frequently asked questions  

## How to use this

- **New team members**: Start with the onboarding section, then explore culture and workflows.  
- **Active contributors**: Use the standards and workflow sections to guide day-to-day work.  
- **All of us**: Treat this as a conversation, open issues, suggest edits, evolve it.  

## Contributing

We expect the handbook itself to evolve as we learn.  
Before making changes, read [CONTRIBUTING.md]. Provide clear rationale, link to relevant discussions, and iterate thoughtfully.
